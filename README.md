# Diabetes Dynamics: A Data Analytics Approach

📊 A data-driven project analyzing the behavioral, clinical, and socio-demographic factors influencing diabetes risk, using advanced big data and machine learning tools.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

This project explores and models diabetes risk factors to uncover insights that support more effective and equitable healthcare interventions. By leveraging a large health indicators dataset and advanced ML algorithms, we aim to:

- Identify high-impact predictors of diabetes
- Analyze risk variations across demographic groups
- Support targeted public health strategies

---

## 👨‍⚕️ Research Questions

1. Which health and lifestyle indicators have the strongest predictive power for identifying diabetes risk?
2. How do socio-demographic factors (income, education, gender, age) influence diabetes prevalence?
3. How can machine learning improve diabetes risk prediction and healthcare planning?
