# Proposed Dataset Selection

The dataset for this project consists of 253680 records, indicating a substantial sample size for robust analysis. It encompasses a wide array of health-related factors, lifestyle choices, socio-demographic information, and self-reported health statuses, providing a comprehensive view of contributors to diabetes risk.

Here is an overview of the columns that are in the dataset:

1. Target Variable:
   - Diabetes: Indicates the diabetes status (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Prediabetes, 2 = Diabetes).

2. Health Indicators:
   - HighBP: Presence of high blood pressure (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   - HighChol: Presence of high cholesterol (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   - BMI: Body Mass Index.

3. Lifestyle Factors:
   - Smoker: Smoking status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   - PhysActivity: Physical activity in the past 30 days (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   - Fruits: Frequency of consuming fruits (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   - Veggies: Frequency of consuming vegetables (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   - HvyAlcoholConsump: Heavy alcohol consumption (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

4. Healthcare Access:
   - AnyHealthcare: Presence of any kind of healthcare coverage (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
   - NoDocbcCost: Avoidance of doctor visits due to cost (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

5. Self-Reported Health Status:
   - GenHlth: General health perception on a scale of 1-5.
   - MentHlth: Days with poor mental health in the past 30 days.
   - PhysHlth: Days with poor physical health in the past 30 days.

   - Education: Education level (scale 1-6).
   - Income: Income level (scale 1-8).

These features cover a wide range of factors that can be explored to understand the relationships and patterns within the dataset regarding diabetes risk and related health aspects. Depending on your specific research questions, we might further refine the selection of features for in-depth analysis.
