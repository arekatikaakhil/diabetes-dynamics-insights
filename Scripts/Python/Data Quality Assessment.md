# DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

The Data Quality Assessment conducted on the dataset has yielded several key findings that underscore the high quality and reliability of the data. These findings provide a solid foundation for further analysis, decision-making, and interpretation of results.

## 1. Completeness:
We conducted a thorough assessment of the dataset to identify any missing values across all columns. The result of this check revealed that there are no missing values present in any of the columns. Each variable in the dataset contains complete data, indicating a high level of completeness.
Result: The dataset exhibits no missing values, resulting in a percentage of missing data of 0.00%.

## 2. Accuracy:
As part of our data quality assessment, we focused on verifying the accuracy of BMI values within the dataset. Using an expected range of 0 to 100 for BMI values, we compared each value against this range to identify any outliers or inaccuracies. The analysis showed that all BMI values fall within the expected range.
Result: There are no incorrect BMI values present in the dataset, as all values are within the expected range of 0 to 100.

## 3. Relevance:
To understand the relevance of certain variables to our research questions, we examined the distribution of the 'HighBP' variable. The analysis revealed the following distribution: 144,851 instances of '0' (indicating no high blood pressure) and 108,829 instances of '1' (indicating high blood pressure). This distribution provides valuable insights into the prevalence of high blood pressure within the dataset, which is directly relevant to our research objectives.
Result: The distribution of the 'HighBP' variable provides relevant information for our analysis, highlighting the prevalence of high blood pressure among individuals in the dataset.

## 4. Validity:
Finally, we conducted a validity check for the 'PhysActivity' variable to ensure that only valid values of '0' (inactive) or '1' (active) are present. The analysis confirmed that all values in the 'PhysActivity' column adhere to the expected valid values, indicating no inconsistencies or invalid entries.
Result: All values in the 'PhysActivity' column are valid, demonstrating the integrity and validity of the dataset.

In summary, the Data Quality Assessment demonstrates that the dataset is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by complete, accurate, relevant, valid, and consistent data. These findings engender confidence in the reliability of the dataset for conducting in-depth analysis, making informed decisions, and deriving actionable insights. The high-quality data serves as a cornerstone for generating sound conclusions and recommendations, thereby empowering stakeholders with the information needed for effective decision-making and strategic planning.
